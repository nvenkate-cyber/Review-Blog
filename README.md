## react usage

npm init to create the package file, this to just use the npm install and automatically installs packages 

install the react package and save it to the package.json
npm install react --save 


npm install -g create-react-app
npx create-react-app frontend  

npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd frontend
  npm start

Happy hacking!
