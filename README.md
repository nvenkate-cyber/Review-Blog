<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot](https://i.ibb.co/yfqdxNn/Screen-Shot-2021-08-12-at-5-34-15-AM.png)

This project was created in summer 2021 over the course of 3 weeks for a final group project in the MLH 
Production Engineering Fellowship. Production Engineering is a hybrid between software & systems engineering that works across product & infrastructure to make sure services are reliable & scalable. The
fellowship was a 12 week remote program where participants gained practical skills thanks to educational content from Linux Foundation Training & Certification's LFS201 – Essentials of System Administrationtraining course, which covers how to administer, configure and upgrade Linux systems, along with the tools and concepts necessary to efficiently build and manage a production Linux infrastructure.
